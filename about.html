<h2 class=" mt-4 text-success"><b>Online Food Ordering</b></h2>
<p class=" ">Food ordering online is becoming a norm for restaurants which offer takeout and delivery orders. Food ordering online is designed as it is cost effective yet an efficient system to satisfy the restaurants needs. The system is also designed for its ultimate flexibility and performance.
           
            In restaurant-controlled online food ordering, the restaurants create their own website and app, or choose to hire a delivery vendor. If they choose to create their own website, they make sure to obtain software that manages the orders efficiently, meaning it has the capability to manage different orders at once.When they hire a vendor, the restaurant pays for a monthly fee or percentage-based fees. The vendor covers the developmental costs.
            A customer can choose to have the food delivered or for pick-up.The process consists of a customer choosing the restaurant of their choice, scanning the menu items, choosing an item, and finally choosing for pick-up or delivery. Payment is then administered by paying with a credit card or debit card through the app or website or in cash at the restaurant when going to pickup.The website and app inform the customer of the food quality, duration of food preparation, and when the food is ready for pick-up or the amount of time it will take for delivery.</p>

            <h2 class=" mt-4 text-success"><b>Advantages</b></h2>

<p>The online ordering trend is exploding and for good reason.

    There are so many advantages to using an online food ordering system. These days it's a critical component of a successful food business.
    
    Below are a list of benefits and advantages that you gain from using such a system</p>
    
  <ul>
    <li> <h4>Improve customer loyalty</h4></li>
    An online ordering system helps build your customer loyalty.
    
    The main reason is that it makes it easier for modern-day consumers to place an order.
    
    For the customer it means easily re-ordering their favourite order, not needing to wait in a line and no errors in their order.
    
    These customer advantages help improve your relationship with them and in-turn lead to greater ordering frequency
    
    <li><h4>Improve operational efficiency</h4></li>
    Perhaps one of the main advantages of an online food ordering system is the improvement to your operational efficiency.
    
    With an ordering system, you can accept any amount of orders at once.
    
    There is no bottleneck with staff availability slowing down order taking.
    
    There is no need to worry about always answering the phones.
    
    All this leads to smaller lines, lower wait times and less chance of incorrect orders.
    
    These benefits have a tremendous impact on your store efficiency which will lead to greater sales and revenue
    
<li>   <h4> Gather valuable data</h4></li>
    Imagine being able to collect valuable customer information during the ordering process.
    
    Acquiring customer e-mail's and phone numbers helps you market your restaurant.
    
    You can use the information to send our your latest promotions to all customers.
    
    It also provides you with a record of everything ordered, the times they have been ordered and who ordered what.
    
    This kind of business intelligence is invaluable and can help you make better decisions that are in line with your customer's interest.
    
    <li><h4>Entice your customers</h4></li>
    Online ordering systems allow your customers to view all your dishes with high-quality pictures.
    
    They can also easily view all the customization options available.
    
    This is very enticing for customers as it means they know what they are ordering and what can be modified. There is no need to ask a staff member whether its possible to add this or remove that.
    
    Remember, customers eat with their eyes first.
    
  <li> <h4> Acquire customers who only order online</h4></li>
    Let's face it, more and more customers are jumping on the bandwagon of only ordering food online.
    
    They simply will not order from businesses which don't offer this service.
    
    They are looking for convenience, if your business doesn't provide this, they won't be a customer.
    
    For the price of ordering systems these days, it's definitely worth using if only to acquire these customers.
    
   <li> <h4>Build your web presence</h4></li>
    A good web presence is critical to marketing your restaurant digitally.
    
    More and more hungry consumers are looking online for where to have their next meal.
    
    An online ordering system puts you on the map and helps customers find you online.
    
    Best of all, if they like what they see, they are only a few clicks away from making an order.
    
    It also gives you another point of contact to be shared around on social media channels</p>
